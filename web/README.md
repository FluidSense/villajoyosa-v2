# Villajoyosa-v2

This is my webpage for an apartment in Villajoyosa, Spain.
I previously made the first version in pure HTML and CSS for my aunt, but I grew tired of maintaining image tags and -order whenever someone sent a new image we wanted to have on the page.
As such, I figured I would create a new page with a CMS, to more easily order and edit content.

## Web

The web is a Next.js project.
Get started with `npm i` and `npm run dev`.

## CMS

The CMS is powered by Sanity.io.
Get started with `npm i` and `npm start`
